It has useful features including – 

 *	Maximum/Minimum Font Size value can be set.
 *	Increase/Decrease of Font Size occurs stepwise as 1px by default. The step value can be set as well.
 *	Reset the font-size to its original value.
 *	Font resize can be implemented on desired HTML sections 


#Getting Started
1. To use the “FontResizeController” plugin, include the jQuery library and the “FontResizeController” plugin inside the <head> tag of your HTML document:
  
`<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/jquery-latest.js"></script> `
`<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/fontResizeController.js"></script> `

2.	Start by telling “FontResizeController” to make the following three <a> elements to control Font-Size by configuring with the “fontResize” property with three possible values namely “increase”, ”decrease” and “reset”.
